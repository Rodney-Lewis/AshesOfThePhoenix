Ashes of the Phoenix is a third-person flying competitive shooter game. Players play as one of two opposing groups of phoenixes attempting to destroy the other phoenixesâ€™ city and eventually their nest. Players can play in a 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3 format, and AI players can fill in empty slots if there are not enough human players to make a match in a given format.
